      see<br><br>the world<br><br>from one<br><br>point of view.</p>

    <p id="blurb">I haven't followed the conventional path to the
      world of web, app, and software development.
      The first half of my life was spent working doubles behind a bar and raising
      my sons as a single mother. In <time>2019</time> I decided it was time for a change, and
      enrolled in the Computer Software Engineering program at <a href="#" class="link">
      Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology</a>.The fire was lit, and my desire
      to create, learn, and understand programming and design has been burning ever since!
      <br>
      <br>My experience gives me a unique advantage.
      <br>
      <br>I have learned the best ideas can come from the most unexpected
      places; diversity and adversity are provenances for new perspectives
      and creative solutions.</p>

          <p class="skills_p">Coinciding with effective
            listening is clear and cogent communication. Be it written or verbal,
            formal or informal, external or internal, conveying ideas and issues
            thuroughly and professionally will affect relationships and

            <br>As a creative thinker and someone who approcahes problems from new
            directions, sometimes the tried and true solution is still the best.
            Reaserch, experimentation, peer review, testing; finding the most effective
            solution is always a priority.
